# Tests for Typst-QCircuit

Here, tests for the library are collected. There are 
- some unit tests testing the Typst code for things like correct gate and instruction creation as well as
- output image comparisons for regression tests. 

The tests are instrumented using Pythons `unittest` library. 

## Setup

The tests can be run using any Python test runner.
