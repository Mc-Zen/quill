# Tests for Quill

Here, tests for the library are collected. There are 
- some unit tests testing the Typst code for things like correct gate and instruction creation as well as
- output image comparisons for regression tests. 

The tests are instrumented using [tytanic](https://github.com/tingerrr/tytanic).
